[Extract\n  serializers](https://luckyframework.org/guides/writing-json-apis/#respond-with-json)\n  for reusable JSON responses.\n\n### Database models\n\n```crystal\n# Set up the model\nclass User < BaseModel\n  table :users do\n    column last_active_at : Time\n    column last_name : String\n    column nickname : String?\n  end\nend\n```\n\n- Sets up the columns that you’d like to use, along with their types\n- You can add `?` to the type when the column can be `nil` . Crystal will then\n  help you remember not to call methods on it that won't work.\n- Lucky will set up presence validations for required fields\n  (`last_active_at` and `last_name` since they are not marked as nilable).\n\n### Querying the database\n\n```crystal\n# Add some methods to help query the database\nclass UserQuery < User::BaseQuery\n  def recently_active\n    last_active_at.gt(1.week.ago)\n  end\n\n  def sorted_by_last_name\n    last_name.lower.desc_order\n  end\nend\n\n# Query the database\nUserQuery.new.recently_active.sorted_by_last_name\n```\n\n- `User::BaseQuery` is automatically generated when you define a model. Inherit\n  from it to customize queries.\n- Set up named scopes with instance methods.\n- Lucky sets up methods for all the columns so that if you mistype a column\n  name it will tell you at compile-time.\n- Use the `lower` method on a `String` column to make sure Postgres sorts\n  everything in lowercase.\n- Use `gt` to get users last active greater than 1 week ago. Lucky has lots\n  of powerful abstractions for creating complex queries, and type specific\n  methods (like `lower`).\n\n### Rendering HTML:\n\n```crystal\nclass Users::Index < BrowserAction\n  route do\n    users = UserQuery.new.sorted_by_last_name\n    render IndexPage, users: users\n  end\nend\n\nclass Users::IndexPage < MainLayout\n  needs users : UserQuery\n\n  def content\n    render_new_user_button\n    render_user_list\n  end\n\n  private def render_new_user_button\n    link \"New User\", to: Users::New\n  end\n\n  private def render_user_list\n    ul class: \"user-list\" do\n      @users.each do |user|\n        li do\n          link user.name, to: Users::Show.with(user.id)\n          text \" - \"\n          text user.nickname || \"No Nickname\"\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\n- `needs users : UserQuery` tells the compiler that it must be passed users\n  of the type `UserQuery`.\n- If you forget to pass something that a page needs, it will let you know at\n  compile time. **Fewer bugs and faster debugging**.\n- Write tags with Crystal methods. Tags are automatically closed and\n  whitespace is removed.\n- Easily extract named methods since pages are made of regular classes and\n  methods. **This makes your HTML pages incredibly easy to read.**\n- Link to other pages with ease. Just use the action name: `Users::New`. Pass\n  params using `with`: `Users::Show.with(user.id)`. No more trying to remember path\n  helpers and whether the helper is pluralized or not - If you forget to pass a\n  param to a route, Lucky will let you know at compile-time.\n- Since we defined `column nickname : String?` as nilable, Lucky would fail\n  to compile the page if you just did `text user.nickname` since it disallows\n  printing `nil`. So instead we add a fallback `\"No Nickname\"`. **No more\n  accidentally printing empty text in HTML!**\n\n## Testing\n\nYou need to make sure to install the Crystal dependencies.\n\n1. Run `shards install`\n1. Run `crystal spec` from the project root.\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Lucky to have you!\n\nWe love all of the community members that have put in hard work to make Lucky better.\nIf you're one of those people, we want to give you a t-shirt!\n\nTo get a shirt, we ask that you have made a significant contribution to Lucky.\nThis includes things like submitting PRs with bug fixes and feature implementations, helping other members\nwork through problems, and deploying real world applications using Lucky!\n\nTo claim your shirt, [fill in this form](https://forms.gle/w3PJ4pww8WDAuJov5).\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [paulcsmith](https://github.com/paulcsmith) Paul Smith - creator, maintainer\n- [Our wonderful community](https://github.com/luckyframework/lucky/graphs/contributors) - ❤️\n\n## Thanks & attributions\n\n- SessionHandler, CookieHandler and FlashHandler are based on [Amber](https://github.com/amberframework/amber).

the result of a method to the page as if it was passed as an argument.\n\nImagine having data that is used by many actions across your app, such\nas the current user. It can get tedious to pass that data for every action.\nThe `expose` macro will make sure that whatever data you need is passed\nautomatically.\n\nHere's what things might look like without `expose`:\n\n```\nclass BrowserAction\n  def current_user\n    # some way to find the current user\n  end\nend\n```\n\nEach action must pass `current_user` manually. Note that each action\ninherits from `BrowserAction` and therefore has access to `current_user`:\n\n```\nclass Messages::Index < BrowserAction\n  get \"/messages\" do\n    html IndexPage, current_user: current_user\n  end\nend\n\nclass Messages::New < BrowserAction\n  get \"/messages/new\" do\n    html NewPage, current_user: current_user\n  end\nend\n```\n\nPassing `current_user: current_user` every time gets pretty old. Enter\n`expose`:\n\n```\nclass BrowserAction\n  expose current_user\n\n  def current_user\n    # some way to find the current user\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow our actions are much nicer, especially when we start to have multiple\narguments for each action:\n\n```\nclass Messages::Index < BrowserAction\n  get \"/messages\" do\n    html IndexPage\n  end\nend\n\nclass Messages::New < BrowserAction\n  get \"/messages/new\" do\n    html NewPage\n  end\nend\n```\n\n## Exposing private methods\n\nAlso useful is the ability to make a private method available:\n\n```\nclass Messages::Show < BrowserAction\n  expose message\n\n  get \"/messages/:id\" do\n    html ShowPage\n  end\n\n  private def message\n    MessageQuery.find(id)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nUsing `expose` here will pass `message` to the `ShowPage`, while keeping the\nmethod private. Without `expose` the action would look like this:\n\n```\nget \"/messages/:id\" do\n  html ShowPage, message: message\nend\n```","summary":"<p>Sends the result of a method to the page as if it was passed as an argument.</p>","abstract":false,"args":[{"name":"method_name","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"method_name","restriction":""}],"args_string":"(method_name)","location":{"filename":"src/lucky/exposable.cr","line_number":109,"url":null},"def":{"name":"expose","args":[{"name":"method_name","doc":null,"default_value":"","external_name":"method_name","restriction":""}],"double_splat":null,"splat_index":null,"block_arg":null,"visibility":"Public","body":"    \n{% method_name_str = method_name.stringify %}\n\n    \n{% if (method_name_str.ends_with?('?')) || (method_name_str.ends_with?('!')) %}\n      {% method_name.raise(\"\\nMethods ending in '?' or '!' cannot be exposed to pages.\\n#{@type.name} called `expose #{method_name_str.id}`\\n\\nTry this...\\n\\n  ▸ Define your method without ? or ! then...\\n  ▸ expose #{(method_name_str.gsub(/[!?]$/, \"\")).id}\") %}\n    {% end %}\n\n    \n{% EXPOSURES << method_name.id %}\n\n  \n"}}],"types":[]},{"html_id":"lucky/Lucky/FileResponse","path":"Lucky/FileResponse.html","kind":"class","full_name":"Lucky::FileResponse","name":"FileResponse","abstract":false,"superclass":{"html_id":"lucky/Lucky/Response","kind":"class","full_name":"Lucky::Response","name":"Response"},"ancestors":[{"html_id":"lucky/Lucky/Response","kind":"class","full_name":"Lucky::Response","name":"Response"},{"html_id":"lucky/Reference","kind":"class","full_name":"Reference","name":"Reference"},{"html_id":"lucky/Object","kind":"class","full_name":"Object","name":"Object"}],"locations":[{"filename":"src/lucky/file_response.cr","line_number":41,"url":null}],"repository_name":"lucky","program":false,"enum":false,"alias":false,"aliased":null,"aliased_html":null,"const":false,"constants":[{"id":"DEFAULT_STATUS","name":"DEFAULT_STATUS","value":"200","doc":null,"summary":null}],"included_modules":[],"extended_modules":[],"subclasses":[],"including_types":[],"namespace":{"html_id":"lucky/Lucky","kind":"module","full_name":"Lucky","name":"Lucky"},"doc":"Return a file's contents for the request.\n\n`file` can be used to return a file and it's contents to the browser, or\nrender the contents of the file inline to a web browser.

`String` represents an immutable sequence of UTF-8 characters.\n\nA `String` is typically created with a string literal, enclosing UTF-8 characters\nin double quotes:\n\n```\n\"hello world\"\n```\n\nA backslash can be used to denote some characters inside the string:\n\n```\n\"\\\"\" # double quote\n\"\\\\\" # backslash\n\"\\e\" # escape\n\"\\f\" # form feed\n\"\\n\" # newline\n\"\\r\" # carriage return\n\"\\t\" # tab\n\"\\v\" # vertical tab\n```\n\nYou can use a backslash followed by an *u* and four hexadecimal characters to denote a unicode codepoint written:\n\n```\n\"\\u0041\" # == \"A\"\n```\n\nOr you can use curly braces and specify up to six hexadecimal numbers (0 to 10FFFF):\n\n```\n\"\\u{41}\" # == \"A\"\n```\n\nA string can span multiple lines:\n\n```\n\"hello\n      world\" # same as \"hello\\n      world\"\n```\n\nNote that in the above example trailing and leading spaces, as well as newlines,\nend up in the resulting string. To avoid this, you can split a string into multiple lines\nby joining multiple literals with a backslash:\n\n```\n\"hello \" \\\n\"world, \" \\\n\"no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, a backslash followed by a newline can be inserted inside the string literal:\n\n```\n\"hello \\\n     world, \\\n     no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n```\n\nIn this case, leading whitespace is not included in the resulting string.\n\nIf you need to write a string that has many double quotes, parentheses, or similar\ncharacters, you can use alternative literals:\n\n```\n# Supports double quotes and nested parentheses\n%(hello (\"world\")) # same as \"hello (\\\"world\\\")\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested brackets\n%[hello [\"world\"]] # same as \"hello [\\\"world\\\"]\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested curlies\n%{hello {\"world\"}} # same as \"hello {\\\"world\\\"}\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested angles\n%<hello <\"world\">> # same as \"hello <\\\"world\\\">\"\n```\n\nTo create a `String` with embedded expressions, you can use string interpolation:\n\n```\na = 1\nb = 2\n\"sum = #{a + b}\" # \"sum = 3\"\n```\n\nThis ends up invoking `Object#to_s(IO)` on each expression enclosed by `#{...}`.\n\nIf you need to dynamically build a string, use `String#build` or `IO::Memory`.\n\n### Non UTF-8 valid strings\n\nString might end up being conformed of bytes which are an invalid\nbyte sequence according to UTF-8. This can happen if the string is created\nvia one of the constructors that accept bytes, or when getting a string\nfrom `String.build` or `IO::Memory`. No exception will be raised, but\ninvalid byte sequences, when asked as chars, will use the unicode replacement\nchar (value 0xFFFD). For example:\n\n```\n# here 255 is not a valid byte value in the UTF-8 encoding\nstring = String.new(Bytes[255, 97])\nstring.valid_encoding? # => false\n\n# The first char here is the unicode replacement char\nstring.chars # => ['�', 'a']\n```\n\nOne can also create strings with specific byte value in them by\nusing octal and hexadecimal escape sequences:\n\n```\n# Octal escape sequences\n\"\\101\" # # => \"A\"\n\"\\12\"  # # => \"\\n\"\n\"\\1\"   # string with one character with code point 1\n\"\\377\" # string with one byte with value 255\n\n# Hexadecimal escape sequences\n\"\\x41\" # # => \"A\"\n\"\\xFF\" # string with one byte with value 255\n```\n\nThe reason for allowing strings that don't have a valid UTF-8 sequence\nis that the world is full of content that isn't properly encoded,\nand having a program raise an exception or stop because of this\nis not good. It's better if programs are more resilient, but\nshow a replacement character when there's an error in incoming data.","summary":"<p>A <code><a href=\"String.html\">String</a></code> represents an immutable sequence of UTF-8 characters.</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[],"instance_methods":[{"id":"squish:String-instance-method","html_id":"squish:String-instance-method","name":"squish","doc":"Returns a new string with whitespace and newlines squish to a single space.\n\n`String#squish` strips whitespace at the end of the string, and changes\nconsecutive whitespace groups into one space each.
