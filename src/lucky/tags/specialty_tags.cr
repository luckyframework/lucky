  # Generates a meta tag to specify the character encoding as UTF-8.

  # Generates a meta tag telling browsers to render the page as wide as the
  # device screen/window and at an initial scale of 1.
  #
  # Should only be used if the page is intended to be viewed on mobile devices.
  # See the [MDN's documentation on the meta
  # tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta) for
  # details.

  # Adds *string* directly to the rendered HTML with no escaping.
  #
  # For example,
  # ```
  # raw "<hopefully-something-safe>" # Renders "<hopefully-something-safe>"
  # ```
  #
  # For custom elements, it's recommended to use the `tag` method.
  #
  # NOTE: Should **never** be used to render unescaped user-generated data, as
  # this can leave one vulnerable to [cross-site scripting
  # attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting).
