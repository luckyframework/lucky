The goal: prevent bugs, forget about most performance issues, and spend more
time on code instead of debugging and fixing tests.

In summary, make writing stunning web applications fast, fun, and easy.

## Try Lucky

Lucky has a [fresh new set of guides](https://luckyframework.org/guides/) that
make it easy to get started.

## Documentation

[API (master)](https://luckyframework.github.io/lucky/)

## What's it look like?

### JSON endpoint:

```crystal
class Api::Users::Show < ApiAction
  route do
    json user_json
  end

  private def user_json
    user = UserQuery.find(user_id)
    {name: user.name, email: user.email}
  end
end
```

- `route` sets up a route for `"/api/users/:user_id"` automatically.
- If you want you can set up custom routes like `get "sign_in"` for non REST routes.
- A `user_id` method is generated because there is a `user_id` route parameter.
- Use `json` to render JSON. [Extract
  serializers](https://luckyframework.org/guides/writing-json-apis/#respond-with-json)
  for reusable JSON responses.

### Database models

```crystal
# Set up the model
class User < BaseModel
  table :users do
    column last_active_at : Time
    column last_name : String
    column nickname : String?
  end
end
```

- Sets up the columns that you’d like to use, along with their types
- You can add `?` to the type when the column can be `nil` . Crystal will then
  help you remember not to call methods on it that won't work.
- Lucky will set up presence validations for required fields
  (`last_active_at` and `last_name` since they are not marked as nilable).

### Querying the database

```crystal
# Add some methods to help query the database
class UserQuery < User::BaseQuery
  def recently_active
    last_active_at.gt(1.week.ago)
  end

  def sorted_by_last_name
    last_name.lower.desc_order
  end
end

# Query the database
UserQuery.new.recently_active.sorted_by_last_name
```

- `User::BaseQuery` is automatically generated when you define a model. Inherit
  from it to customize queries.
- Set up named scopes with instance methods.
- Lucky sets up methods for all the columns so that if you mistype a column
  name it will tell you at compile-time.
- Use the `lower` method on a `String` column to make sure Postgres sorts
  everything in lowercase.
- Use `gt` to get users last active greater than 1 week ago. Lucky has lots
  of powerful abstractions for creating complex queries, and type specific
  methods (like `lower`).

### Rendering HTML:

```crystal
class Users::Index < BrowserAction
  route do
    users = UserQuery.new.sorted_by_last_name
    render IndexPage, users: users
  end
end

class Users::IndexPage < MainLayout
  needs users : UserQuery

  def content
    render_new_user_button
    render_user_list
  end

  private def render_new_user_button
    link "New User", to: Users::New
  end

  private def render_user_list
    ul class: "user-list" do
      @users.each do |user|
        li do
          link user.name, to: Users::Show.with(user.id)
          text " - "
          text user.nickname || "No Nickname"
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

- `needs users : UserQuery` tells the compiler that it must be passed users
  of the type `UserQuery`.
- If you forget to pass something that a page needs, it will let you know at
  compile time. **Fewer bugs and faster debugging**.
- Write tags with Crystal methods. Tags are automatically closed and
  whitespace is removed.
- Easily extract named methods since pages are made of regular classes and
  methods. **This makes your HTML pages incredibly easy to read.**
- Link to other pages with ease. Just use the action name: `Users::New`. Pass
  params using `with`: `Users::Show.with(user.id)`. No more trying to remember path
  helpers and whether the helper is pluralized or not - If you forget to pass a
  param to a route, Lucky will let you know at compile-time.
- Since we defined `column nickname : String?` as nilable, Lucky would fail
  to compile the page if you just did `text user.nickname` since it disallows
  printing `nil`. So instead we add a fallback `"No Nickname"`. **No more
  accidentally printing empty text in HTML!**
