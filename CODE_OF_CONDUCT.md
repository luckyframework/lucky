# Open Source Code of Conduct

In order to foster an inclusive, kind, harassment-free, and cooperative community, the Lucky team enforces this code of conduct on our open source projects.

## Summary

Harassment in code and discussion or violation of physical boundaries is completely unacceptable anywhere in Lucky's codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, mailing lists, meetups, and other events. Violators will be warned by the core team. Repeat violations will result in being blocked or banned by the core team at or before the 3rd violation.

## In detail

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Individuals asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Maintainers are also subject to the anti-harassment policy.

If anyone engages in harassing behavior, including maintainers, we may take appropriate action, up to and including warning the offender, deletion of comments, removal from the project’s codebase and communication systems, and escalation to GitHub support.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the core team on Twitter on privately on Discord (@Paul Smith).

We expect everyone to follow these rules anywhere in Lucky's codebases, issue trackers, chatrooms, and mailing lists.

Finally, don't forget that it is human to make mistakes! We all do. Let’s work together to help each other, resolve issues, and learn from the mistakes that we will all inevitably make from time to time.

## Avoid using negative emoji reactions

Avoid using the 👎 or 😕 emoji for comments or PRs. It does not provide
enough value because it is not clear
**why** you are confused or what you disagree with. Instead, write a comment
explaining what you found confusing or that you don't like.

Some example responses instead of emoji:

- "I understand what you're trying to say, but I think that it will cause X problem."
- "I'm not sure I understand, could you include a gist explaining the use-case?"
